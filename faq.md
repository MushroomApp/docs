Have questions about Mushroom? Check out the FAQ below to help you get started!

## **1. What is Mushroom?**

Mushroom is an app where you can live broadcast and hang out with friends, just like in real life but better. Everybody gets their own room and you can pull anyone into it, while live broadcasting. You can find friends to join you in an instant and watch the same video while talking with others.

## **2. I registered with my phone number. Can people see my number while I broadcast?**

Nope! This information is kept secure, and is only used to log in to the app. That being said, you can invite contacts from your phone to broadcast with you. If your contacts join, you will be connected with them as friends on Mushroom.

## **3. How can I join a room?**

Simply click on your homescreen and select someone who is broadcasting! You can enter any room you’d like.

## **4. How can I join someone else’s broadcast?**

Once you’re in a room, the broadcaster who owns the room can drag you on screen to broadcast with them! Similarly, if you are the room owner, you can drag anyone on screen to broadcast with you.

## **5. What are the group chats within a room, and how can I join one?**

When you are watching someone broadcast in a room, you can pull up to three other broadcasters into a group with you. You, and up to three other friends, can watch the live broadcaster together.
